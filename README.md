# Symfony 7 tutorial

This repo is based on the [Cosmic Coding with Symfony 7](https://symfonycasts.com/screencast/symfony7)
course on SymfonyCasts. On top of the code base, I added a dockerized version to simplify the installation of the stack.
 So, you will find a pre-configured [frankenphp](https://frankenphp.dev/docs/docker/) docker service.

## Cosmic Coding with Symfony 7

Well hi there! This repository holds the code and script for the
[Cosmic Coding with Symfony 7](https://symfonycasts.com/screencast/symfony7)
course on SymfonyCasts.

## Have Ideas, Feedback or an Issue?

If you have suggestions or questions, please feel free to open an issue
on this repository or comment on the course itself. We're watching both :).
